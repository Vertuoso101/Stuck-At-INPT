# Stuck-At-INPT
This is a personal project that i worked on, this folder contains the backend of a stackoverflow copy that would allow students from my school to post their questions
and interact with each other.
To use this app you must have a node v12 or higher, and install the dependencies by using the commande "npm install", then insert the link of your own mongodb database
to be able to connect to it.
This project is not perfect but it contains all basic functionalities that you need to have in a stackoverflow copy backend.
